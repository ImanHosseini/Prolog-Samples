# Prolog-Samples
Some Prolog exercises. <br />
1_ A regex parser  <br />
2_ NFA simulator <br />
3_ Mathematical expressions, Infix to Prefix converter <br />
4_ A simple Machine Sim (You can figure out the opcodes by inspecting the codes) <br />
5_ Fun with Symmetric Group <br />
5_ the idea with 5 was to define the Symmetric Group (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group) such that prolog could take two elements and calculate their product. And then I wanted to have it calculate the commuator subgroup, and I wanted to show that for n>=5 if you take S_n and keep calculating the commutator subgroup you'll get a 60 element group (the alternating group) which does not get smaller, but for smaller n it keeps getting smaller until getting to {1}. This is the underlying reason why quintic (or 6th degree or more) doesn't admit a closed form solution in the Field of radicals. (like quadratic equation for example.)
